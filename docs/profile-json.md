# Input profile `json`

A simple, general MQTT format: one topic per device, each message one JSON object with all current values and the time of measurement. Any data source can produce it, for example a Node-RED flow, a script or your own Modbus reader.

The profile is available for both devices: the heat pump and the Energy Butler.

## Topics

One topic per device, both configurable in the instance settings:

| Device | Default topic |
|---|---|
| Heat pump | `energy/heatpump/telemetry` |
| Energy Butler | `energy/butler/telemetry` |

Leave a topic empty if you do not have that device.

## Message

```json
{
  "name": "butler",
  "fields": {
    "battery_soc_percent": 81,
    "pv_total_power_w": 2300,
    "grid_import_power_w": 628,
    "grid_export_power_w": 0
  },
  "timestamp": 1791956345000
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fields` | Object with the values, field name → number. Required. |
| `timestamp` | Time of measurement as Unix time in milliseconds. Required. |
| `name` | Optional, ignored by the adapter. |

Values are plain numbers. On/off values are sent as `0` or `1`.

## Rules

- **Time of measurement:** Every value gets `timestamp` as its `ts`. History adapters (InfluxDB, SQL) therefore store the real time of measurement, not the time of receipt.
- **Duplicates and older messages** are detected by `timestamp` and discarded: a message is only processed if its `timestamp` is newer than the last processed one. QoS 1 and buffering at the source are therefore no problem.
- **Timestamps more than 60 s in the future** are rejected. In that case the clock of the source or of the ioBroker host is wrong.
- **One message is a complete snapshot.** Send all fields you have in every message. A known field that is missing, or that is not a number, sets its data point to `null` with quality `0x82` (sensor reported no value), so an old value does not stay.
- **Missing is not 0.** If a sensor fails, leave its field out instead of sending 0. 0 is a valid value.
- **New fields** that are not listed below are created automatically as numbers and reported once in the log.
- **Outdated data:** If the last measurement is older than the configured limit (default 20 s), `<device>.info.stale` becomes `true`. A send interval of a few seconds (for example 5 s) is recommended.
- **QoS and retain:** QoS 0 or 1 both work. Retain is not needed; a retained message is processed like any other, and `info.stale` shows its age.

## Heat pump fields

Tested with an M-TEC heat pump with KEBA controller (AHPA series).

| Field | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `dhw_top_temperature_c` | Hot water tank top | °C |
| `buffer_bottom_temperature_c` | Buffer tank bottom | °C |
| `heating_flow_after_mixer_temperature_c` | Heating circuit flow after the mixer | °C |
| `flow_temperature_c` | Heat pump flow | °C |
| `return_temperature_c` | Heat pump return | °C |
| `outdoor_temperature_c` | Outdoor temperature | °C |
| `heatpump_target_temperature_c` | Current target temperature | °C |
| `electrical_power_w` | Electrical power | W |
| `thermal_power_w` | Thermal power | W |
| `cop` | Current coefficient of performance | – |
| `heating_water_mass_flow_kg_s` | Heating water mass flow | kg/s |
| `circulation_pump_percent` | Setpoint of the heat pump circulation pump ¹ | % |
| `compressor_setpoint_percent` | Compressor setpoint ¹ | % |
| `heating_circuit_pump_state` | Separate heating circuit pump on | 0/1 |
| `heating_circuit_mixer_raw` | Mixer setpoint, signed raw value ² | – |
| `dhw_heat_request` | Hot water heat request | 0/1 |
| `buffer_heat_request` | Buffer heat request | 0/1 |
| `consuming_excess_energy` | Excess energy use as reported by the heat pump controller ³ | status |
| `operating_status_code` | Operating status, see below | code |
| `operating_substatus_code` | Sequence status (device-specific codes, not decoded) | code |
| `dhw_sensor_status_code` | Sensor status hot water | 0 = OK |
| `buffer_bottom_sensor_status_code` | Sensor status buffer bottom | 0 = OK |
| `heating_flow_after_mixer_sensor_status_code` | Sensor status heating circuit flow | 0 = OK |
| `flow_sensor_status_code` | Sensor status heat pump flow | 0 = OK |
| `outdoor_sensor_status_code` | Sensor status outdoor temperature | 0 = OK |

¹ Setpoints, not measured speeds.
² The conversion to percent is not known yet.
³ Comes from the heat pump controller and does not prove a PV surplus.

Operating status: 0 standby · 1 pre-run · 2 heating · 3 defrosting · 4 cooling · 5 post-run · 7 safety shutdown · 8 error

`dhw_heat_request`, `buffer_heat_request` and `heating_circuit_pump_state` become booleans in ioBroker.

## Energy Butler fields

| Field | Meaning | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `battery_soc_percent` | Battery state of charge | % |
| `battery_charge_power_w` | Charging power | W, ≥ 0 |
| `battery_discharge_power_w` | Discharging power | W, ≥ 0 |
| `battery_power_signed_w` | Battery power, + discharging, − charging | W |
| `battery_charge_discharge_status_code` | Battery mode: 0 discharging, 1 charging | code |
| `grid_import_power_w` | Grid import | W, ≥ 0 |
| `grid_export_power_w` | Grid export (feed-in) | W, ≥ 0 |
| `grid_total_power_signed_w` | Grid power, − import, + export | W |
| `grid_phase_a_power_signed_w` | Grid power phase A, − import, + export | W |
| `grid_phase_b_power_signed_w` | Grid power phase B, − import, + export | W |
| `grid_phase_c_power_signed_w` | Grid power phase C, − import, + export | W |
| `pv_total_power_w` | PV total power | W |
| `pv1_power_w` | PV input 1 | W |
| `pv2_power_w` | PV input 2 | W |
| `inverter_ac_power_signed_w` | Inverter AC power | W |
| `inverter_operating_status_code` | Inverter status, see below | code |

Inverter status: 0 waiting · 1 self-check · 2 on-grid · 3 fault · 4 firmware update · 5 off-grid

The analysis (`analysis.*`) uses `pv_total_power_w`, `grid_import_power_w`, `grid_export_power_w`, `battery_charge_power_w`, `battery_discharge_power_w` and `battery_soc_percent`. Without these fields there is no house consumption, cost or daily value. Send import/export and charging/discharging as separate fields without sign.

## Examples

With `mosquitto_pub`:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h <broker> -t energy/butler/telemetry \
  -m '{"fields":{"battery_soc_percent":81,"pv_total_power_w":2300,"grid_import_power_w":0,"grid_export_power_w":450,"battery_charge_power_w":1200,"battery_discharge_power_w":0},"timestamp":1791956345000}'
```

In a Node-RED function node in front of an MQTT out node (topic `energy/butler/telemetry`):

```js
msg.payload = {
    fields: {
        battery_soc_percent: flow.get('soc'),
        pv_total_power_w: flow.get('pv'),
    },
    timestamp: Date.now(), // better: the time the values were read
};
return msg;
```

## Checking a broker

`tools/mqtt-check.mjs` listens for a few seconds on the default topics and compares the fields with the definitions above:

```bash
node tools/mqtt-check.mjs --host <broker> --user <user>
```
