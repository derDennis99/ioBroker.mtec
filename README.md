# ioBroker.mtec

Reads an M-TEC **Energy Butler** (hybrid inverter with PV and battery) and an M-TEC **heat pump** from an MQTT broker, creates typed ioBroker data points and analyses the energy flows: house consumption, self-sufficiency, battery forecast, PV surplus, cost, savings and daily values.

The adapter only reads. It never writes anything back to the devices.

German description: [docs/de/README.md](docs/de/README.md)

## Data sources

The adapter does not talk to the devices directly. It reads their values from an MQTT broker, in one of two formats ("input profiles"):

| Profile | Devices | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `json` | Energy Butler and heat pump | One topic per device with a JSON message of `fields` and `timestamp`. Any source can produce it, for example Node-RED or a script. [Format description](docs/profile-json.md) |
| `mtecmqtt` | Energy Butler | The MQTT output of [MTECmqtt](https://github.com/croedel/MTECmqtt). [Details and mapping](docs/profile-mtecmqtt.md) |

With `mtecmqtt` the heat pump can still be read via `json` at the same time.

Direct access via Modbus (without extra software) is planned for a later version.

## Installation

Requirements: Node.js 22 or newer, js-controller 6.0.11 or newer, admin 7.6.20 or newer.

The adapter is published on npm and is being added to the ioBroker repository. As soon as it is listed there, search for "mtec" in the adapter list of the admin, install it and create an instance.

## Configuration

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Broker, port, user, password | Connection to the MQTT broker. The password is stored encrypted. |
| Input profile | `json` or `mtecmqtt` |
| Topics (`json`) | One topic per device, empty = device not present |
| Topic prefix, serial number (`mtecmqtt`) | `MQTT_TOPIC` of MTECmqtt (default `MTEC`); serial number empty = first one seen |
| Data counts as outdated after | Limit for `info.stale` (default 20 s) |
| Slow MTECmqtt groups count as outdated after | Limit for phase and PV string values (default 180 s) |
| Analysis | Usable battery capacity, minimum state of charge, grid price and feed-in tariff (cents per kWh, 0 = not set, values below 1 are read as currency units per kWh), currency, threshold for "solar power to spare" |

If everything works, `mtec.0.info.connection` is `true`, the data points below `mtec.0.butler.*` (and `mtec.0.heatpump.*`) fill up and `info.stale` is `false`.

## Data points

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `info.connection` | Connection to the broker |
| `heatpump.<field>` | 25 values of the heat pump with unit and role, status codes with texts |
| `butler.<field>` | 16 values of the Energy Butler |
| `butler.mtecmqtt.<group>.<name>` | Further values from MTECmqtt (profile `mtecmqtt` only) |
| `<device>.info.lastMeasurement` | Time of the last measurement (ms) |
| `<device>.info.stale` | `true` if the last measurement is older than the configured limit |
| `butler.info.serial` | Serial number (profile `mtecmqtt` only) |

- **Time of measurement:** With `json`, every value gets the time of measurement from the message as `ts`, so history adapters store the real time of measurement.
- **Missing is not 0:** A value that is not reported becomes `null` with quality `0x82` (sensor reported no value); an old value does not stay.
- **For your own logic:** Always check `info.stale` before using a value for a switching decision.

## Analysis

Below `analysis` the adapter calculates from the live values of the Energy Butler:

| Data point | Content |
|---|---|
| `house_power_w` / `house_without_heatpump_w` | House consumption now (PV + import + discharging − export − charging), with and without heat pump |
| `autarky_percent` / `self_consumption_percent` | Self-sufficiency and PV self-consumption now |
| `surplus_w` / `surplus_available` | PV surplus (5 min average) and "solar power to spare" (with hysteresis) |
| `battery_energy_kwh`, `battery_full_in_min`, `battery_empty_in_min`, `battery_status_text` | Battery content and forecast, e.g. "full in 2 h 15 min (approx. 14:35)" |
| `cost_now_per_h` / `savings_now_per_h` | Electricity cost and savings per hour now (only with a configured price) |
| `grid_balance_per_h` / `grid_balance_text` | Grid balance now: + feed-in revenue / − import cost per hour, as number and as text ("+0.27 €/h") |
| `today.*` | Daily values since midnight: PV, import, export, battery, house, heat pump (electricity, heat, COP), self-sufficiency, `cost`, `savings` |

Amounts use the configured currency as unit. The texts follow the system language (German or English).

The daily values are estimated from the power (power × time since the previous measurement, gaps over 60 s are skipped) and survive a restart on the same day. With the profile `mtecmqtt` the real daily energy counters of the Energy Butler replace the estimate.

## Checking a broker

For the profile `json`, `tools/mqtt-check.mjs` listens for a few seconds and compares the fields with the adapter's definitions. With `--user` it asks for the password (hidden input, or from `MQTT_PASSWORD`):

```bash
node tools/mqtt-check.mjs --host <broker> --user <user>
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

The tests cover both input profiles, the analysis and the whole path through a local MQTT broker (aedes). `npm run test:integration` additionally starts the adapter in a real js-controller and checks the data flow from a local broker, `npm run lint` checks the code style and `npm run check` the types (TypeScript on the JavaScript sources).
